  <p dir="ltr">Hello, I am Jeremiah Prokop. I am a Wake Forest High School graduate in 2022. I am the eldest of seven children, and a dog all of whom I love dearly.In my free time I like to read novels and draw, but I do also enjoy videogames. Currently I am attending Wake Tech Community College with an interest in computers, and while my experience with them is fairly basic, I try everyday to improve my skill set. I was originally going to attend NC State in hopes that a major or interest would dawn on me while I was there, but at the last minute I decided that it would probably be best if I got into IT.&nbsp;</p>

  <p dir="ltr">As stated before, at the moment, I don&rsquo;t have extensive experience with computers, so you could say I'm a beginner. I got into computers because I heard it is a demanding career field and I had somewhat of an interest in them. This puts me at a disadvantage because others going into this are more advanced than me; however, I do not let that deter me from trying to meet their level. As of now my goal is to go down the major of IT: Service and Support, so I could potentially be fixing computers and whatnot, which I gained an interest in from building a pc granted I&rsquo;m not done with it but it got me started!</p>
 <br />
  <p>Being a freshman in college I currently do not have anything to really show off as a personal accomplishment besides this website.&nbsp;</p>
